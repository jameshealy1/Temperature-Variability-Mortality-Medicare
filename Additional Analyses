##Effect Modificaiton Analyses
#Code was replicated from previous DID analysis and meta-analyses with the subset function used in each DID regression for different variables of interest


##Poisson Senstivity Model
#Code was replicated from previous DID analysis and meta-analyses with each model changed to family=quasipoisson from 
family=gaussian used in each DID regression for different variables of interst


##Quadratic Sensitivity Models
#Code was replicated from previous DID analysis and meta-analyses with newly created quadratic terms for each of the 
four temperature simply by squaring each variable. These temperature variables were substituted into the regression models instead of the original terms.
